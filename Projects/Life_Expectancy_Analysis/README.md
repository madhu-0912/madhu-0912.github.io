# Economic Vitality and Population Health

## Overview

This project examines the interplay between economic growth, healthcare infrastructure, and non-communicable diseases, with a focus on understanding how prosperity influences health outcomes. We explore the correlation between consumption patterns and health indicators to provide insights into life expectancy and causes of death against the backdrop of economic development.

## Objectives

- To present accurate life expectancy statistics by country and gender, reflecting current global health trends.
- To visualize prominent causes of death, highlighting health disparities among countries and regions.
- To construct a regression model predicting life expectancy variations and exploring the nuanced interplay between life expectancy and economic development.

## Datasets

- **Life Tables by Country**: Detailed mortality dynamics across age groups from WHO, totaling 243,390 rows.
- **Deaths by Non-Communicable Diseases**: Insights into mortality rates by disease type, gender, and country, totaling 43,920 records from WHO.
- **Transformed Dataset**: Focusing on the top 10 economies, including variables like location, period, sex, age group, and key life expectancy-related indicators.
- **GDP Info**: Gross Domestic Product data from the World Bank to correlate with health outcomes.

## Findings

- A temporal analysis of life expectancy across countries from 2000 to 2019.
- GDP trends across 11 countries over the same period, relating economic growth to health.
- Distribution of death rates from four major non-communicable diseases across countries.

## Modeling

- Predicted life expectancy for the year 2030, with Japan leading and Russia at the lower end.
- Cluster analysis grouping countries by prevalent non-communicable diseases and health infrastructure.

## Clustering Results

- **First World**: Countries with advanced healthcare leading to better detection of cancer.
- **Mid-Tier**: Countries where economic conditions contribute to higher rates of diabetes.
- **Emerging Superpowers**: Rapid industrialization affecting respiratory disease rates.
- **Cold War Superpower**: Lifestyle and economic challenges contributing to heart disease prevalence in Russia.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

We've highlighted the stable order of life expectancies, the impact of GDP on health, gender disparities, and environmental and socio-political factors affecting health. Our recommendations are targeted at combating prevalent diseases through lifestyle modifications, environmental initiatives, early detection, and global collaboration.

## Visualizations

The repository includes visualizations in PNG and JPEG formats, illustrating our analytical findings.
