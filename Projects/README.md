# Big Data Analysis of NCDC Weather Records

## Project Overview

This project, conducted as part of the BAN632 Big Data course, dives deep into the meteorological datasets provided by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Our team developed a series of applications using big data tools to analyze weather patterns, with a particular focus on sky ceiling heights and visibility distances at various USAF weather stations.

## Objectives

- To calculate the monthly range of sky ceiling heights across observation stations.
- To compute the average visibility distance for each USAF weather station.
- To utilize big data technologies such as MRJob, PySpark, Pig, and Hive for data processing and analysis.

## Methodology

### Part 1: MRJob
Developed a Mapper and Reducer application in Python to determine the range of sky ceiling heights for each month, handling missing values and ensuring data quality.

### Part 2: PySpark
Implemented a PySpark application to calculate the average visibility distance for each weather station, involving the setup of an AWS Spark cluster and data processing in a distributed environment.

### Part 3: Pig
Used Pig to load data and perform grouped calculations to find the range of sky ceiling heights for each weather station ID, showcasing the ability to manipulate and analyze large datasets.

### Part 4: Hive
Leveraged Hive to create tables and run queries that return the average sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID, demonstrating proficiency in using SQL-like scripting for big data.

## Results

The project successfully harnessed the power of big data tools to analyze vast amounts of weather data. Key achievements include:

- Effective data cleaning and processing to handle significant quantities of meteorological data.
- Insightful analysis of weather patterns, contributing to a deeper understanding of climatic trends.
- Proficiency in various big data technologies, enhancing our data analytics skill set.

## Technologies Used

- MRJob
- PySpark
- Hadoop
- AWS
- Pig
- Hive

## Visualizations

The repository includes PNG visualizations depicting the processed data and analytical results, which illustrate the temporal evolution of weather patterns.

## How to Use

Detailed instructions on running each part of the analysis are provided within the respective directories, alongside the necessary code and data files.
